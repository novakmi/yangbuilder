== Introduction

The [[[yang]]] modeling language is used to describe data model of the configuration. In this way it can be compared to the *XSD*, however the syntax is
rather different (more similar *JSON*). 

Syntax of the data model written in the <<yang>> resembles syntax used in a Groovy builders. Groovy builders can be used to create
parent-child oriented data documents like *XML* and thus also <<yang>>.

NOTE: Here we are comparing similarity of the syntax, not the meaning. The <<yang>> example represents data model,
      the <<groovy>> example represents data model instance (XML with values). With <<groovy>> one can also build *XSD*
      in a same way like *XML*. With *XSD* the meaning would be the same.

NOTE: Because of the syntax similarity, in some Java IDEs (http://netbeans.org/index.html[NetBeans], http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[Intellij IDEA], http://www.eclipse.org/[Eclipse]) 
      it is possible to use groovy mode to get limited editor support for the <<yang>> files (e.g syntax highlighting) out of the box.

Groovy <<yangbuilder>> allows to create <<yang>> data models with similar syntax as <<yang>>.

As you can see, there is only little syntax difference between <<groovy>> and <<yang>>.
NOTE: <<groovy>> syntax in example above was written to be much similar to <<yang>> as possible. The only difference is brackets around element 
      names containing child elements and apostrophes (or quotation marks). In <<groovy>> you can also omit semicolon. 

With yangbuilder one can use groovy script to generate <<yang>> file. This approach has following pros and cons:

*Pros:*

* more advance reuse (functions, closures, parametrization)
* use of programming language
* similar syntax to yang
* (groovy) support in IDE (navigation, syntax highlighting, formatting)
* plugins

*Cons:*

* additional step - yang file has to be generated
* yangbuilder does not support yang validation (use <<pyang>>)
* advanced reuse can lead to bigger yang files (e.g. generate similar parts several times instead of using yang's +grouping+)

== History

There already existed a <<groovy>> as a part o one project I have worked for in my job (owned by customer).

When I was implementing <<groovy>> builder for http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/[PlantUML] called https://bitbucket.org/novakmi/plantumlbuilder[plantumlbuilder],
I have decided to create common builder library <<nodebuilder>> with common support for <<groovy>> builders using
parent-child processing. Than it was relatively easy to base new <<yangbuilder>> on this common library. New <<yangbuilder>> implementation is
completely new, free and supports plugins (provided by <<nodebuilder>>).


=== Dependencies

* <<groovy>> 2.0.0 and newer has to be installed on the system (preferably with +GROOVY_HOME+ set and +$GROOVY_HOME/bin+ in system +PATH+)
* +nodebuilder+ jar file,
* +yangbuilder+ jar file

Note: <<nodebuilder>> and <<yangbuilder>> does not need to be downloaded, if  if <<groovy>> +@Grab+ can be used (PC is connected to Internet)


== Installation

In most cases, there is no need for installation. If you have installed <<groovy>> of version 1.8.0 or newer and Internet connection, the script generating <<yang>> file 
downloads all required dependencies with use of <<groovy>> http://groovy.codehaus.org/Grape[Grape] feature. See +templates/scripts+ directory for example script.
Usually, first run of the script takes some time (downloading dependencies). During second run no dependencies are downloade and Internet connection is not 
needed anymore.

It is also possible to run script or application in regular <<groovy>> way by supplying +classpath+ to the dependent +jar+ files.

TBD footnoteref:[future, This section will be updated in the future to provide more information.]

== Using yangbuilder

See +templates/scripts+ directory to see how write <<yangbuilder>> scripts and generate yang files.
See +templates/project+ directory for sample project that generates several (related) yang files.

=== Example 1

////
Syntax highlighting requires source-highlight package (Ubuntu).
java is used as it is close to groovy syntax
////
.Example groovy script to generate <<Yang>> file based on example from Instant YANG tutorial, section modules
[source,java]

#!/usr/bin/env groovy                                                                                  //<1>
include::acmeYang.tmp[]
-----------
<1> On Unix (Linux) you can run script to generate <<yang>> file as any other executable script +./<scriptName>.groovy+, 
provided <<groovy>> is installed and exec attribute is set. Alternatively (or on Windows) you can run it as +groovy <scriptname>.groovy+.

== +yngbuild+ keyword

This keyword echoes it's value directly to the yang file. This is useful if it is not possible to create content of the  <<yang>> file  
with regular builder syntax (e.g. multiline comments). The +yngbuild+ keyword accepts optional attribute +indent+. If its value 
evaluates to +true+, the elements value is indented according to the current nesting level.

Example:

+builder.yngbuild("/* not indented comment */")+

+builder.yngbuild("/* indented comment */", indent:true)+

== <<yang>> elements with special handling for quotes
 
The value of following <<yang>> elements will be automatically surrounded with quotes if needed (string contains any space or tab characters, a semicolon (";"), 
braces ("{" or "}") or comment sequences ("//", "/*", or "*/"). Double quotes are preferred, if string already contains double quotes, singe quotes
are used. 

(See  http://www.yang-central.org/twiki/pub/Main/YangDocuments/rfc6020.html#rfc.section.6.1.3)

* +namespace+
* +key+
* +pattern+
* +prefix+
* +reference+
* +contact+
* +description+
* +presence+
* +organization+

Example: 

+prefix "example1"+

In addition, following  <<yang>> elements accept optional +multiline+ attribute. 

* +reference+
* +contact+
* +description+
* +presence+
* +organization+

If +multiline+ attribute value evaluates to +true+, the elements value is formatted on several lines.

Example:

[source,java]
---------
description('''The module for entities
implementing the ACME products.''', multiline: true)
---------

is expanded to:

[source,java]
---------
description
   "The module for entities
    implementing the ACME products.";
---------

NOTE: Use +yngbuild+ keyword to override this quote handling behavior.
      e.g. +builder.yngbuild("prefix ''example1''", indent: true)+


== Plugins

Plugins can extend +yangbuilder+ with additional functionality according to the +NodeBuilderPlugin+ abstract 
class interface (part of <<nodebuilder>>).

Currently there is only one plugin being part of <<yangbuilder>> package - the +CompactYangPlugin+.


=== CompactYangPlugin

See +CompactYangPlugin.groovy+ (plugin allowing shorter syntax) for example of plugin implementation and 
+CompactYangPluginTest.groovy+ for plugin usage example.
